# 🥛 DairyFlow Management System

**DairyFlow** is a full-stack MERN application designed to modernize dairy business operations. It replaces outdated manual paperwork with a digital, automated sales and inventory system for Admins and Managers.

## 💡 The Problem & Solution

* **The Problem:** Dairy managers traditionally rely on pen-and-paper registers to track daily sales and stock. This manual process is slow, prone to calculation errors, and makes tracking history difficult.
* **The Solution:** DairyFlow provides a centralized **Admin Dashboard** where managers can "click-and-sell." It automatically updates inventory, calculates billing, and maintains a secure digital record of every transaction.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **👨‍💼 Admin Dashboard:** A secure portal for managers to oversee operations.
* **📦 Inventory Management:** Add, update, and delete dairy products (Milk, Curd, Ghee, etc.).
* **⚡ Quick Sales System:** Point-of-sale interface to process customer orders instantly.
* **📊 Automated Stock Updates:** Inventory decreases automatically as sales occur—no manual counting needed.
* **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Protected routes ensuring only authorized admins can access business data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite/Create React App), Tailwind CSS / CSS3
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
